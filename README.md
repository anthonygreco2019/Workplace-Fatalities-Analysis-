  ## Summary
  
  The workplace fatalities analysis project analyzes data on workplace fatalities and saftey inspection programs across fifty states during 2012.  
  
  ## Business Problem
  
  What apects of workplace saftey programs are most corelated with a lower fatality rate? Identifying  the most relevant aspects of higher preforming workplace saftey programs can help infrom program design and improve program performance.
  
  ## Data
  
  Data consisted of a single CSV file containing data on workplace fatalities, injuries, and illnesses for each state during 2012 as well as data on saftey programs such as average fines issued, number of inspectors, and years to inspect each workplace once.

  The project used exploratory data analysis and visualization methods to identify relevant varibles. Analyst evlauated the coorelation between workplace fatality rates, number of inspectors, and years to inspect workpalces using excel Correl function. 
  
  ## Results
  The project finds that the number of saftey insperctors per fatality rate is modertaley cooralated (-0.5) to over all fatality rate. The higher the number of inspectors, the lower the rate of fatalities on average.
